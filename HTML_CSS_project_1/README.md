Project 1: Introduction to HTML/CSS
---

In this project, the goal was to recreate the google.com landing page.

The primary challenges were:
- Grappling with how to position elements in CSS
- Making use of cascading properties of CSS, making sensible hierarchies.
- Familiarising myself with in-browser Dev Tools
- Making use of proper version control through Github

Primary goals for next project:
- Become more comfortable with Flexbox and CSS Grid for positioning elements
- Decrease bloat
