  <h2>A few small tests</h2>
    <p class="notlink">This paragraph of class notlink is not a link, but it's underlined. That's confusing.</p>
    <p class="notlink blue">This paragraph is blue and underlined, but is not a link. That's even more confusing.</p>
    <p class="centered blue letter-spacing word-spacing">This paragraph is aligned to the center and has wide letter spacing and word spacing. Also it's blue.</p>
